# botproject
this is my first project in general assemply, I have built a slackbot using Hubot.
and here are the commands that you can write to the bot:


__rules__
when you type rules the bot will reply the rules.

__hello I am [nationality of your choosing]__
the bot will reply with a greeting based on your nationality


__give me a background image__
the bot will reply a random background image

__search for [anything that you choose]__
the bot will reply with a link of google search based on your input 


__In this page you'll find the installation steps of the bot__
